# My OSU API

This repo contains a PHP API for [my OSU website](https://github.com/robwhess/my-osu-website/).

You can launch the development version of the API using Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose up
```

By default the API will be accessible on port 8000 of the host machine, though you can change this behavior by setting the `PORT` environment variable.
